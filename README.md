This mobile application that displays “dad” jokes for when users would like to break the tension in a conversation or meeting. Users can load a random joke, or add a new one with a single swipe. 

I created an api with NodeJS, expressJS, and mongoDB. On the front-end I used React Native and Flexbox to build the user experience.
